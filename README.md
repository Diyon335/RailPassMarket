## General info

In Belgium NMBS/SNCB is responsible for public transport by train. One of the ways for
travellers to pay for trips is by buying a Standard Multi (AKA Rail Pass). (snippet from
website )
As the website says it”s money-saving, but only if you use all 10 rides. The Rail Pass expires
after one year, and a lot of times railpasses expire with still several rides on them. This is a
pity, especially since the railpass is transferable.
But who to transfer it to?
Nothing has been set-up to organise the selling-on of Railpasses, and that is exactly what
we are aiming for with this project.
● We want to help people that realise they will not use up all their rides by allowing
them to recover some of the money spent on the Rail Pass rather than letting it
expire. 
● We want to help people that plan a day trip but are not interested in a Multi Pass,
because they rarely take the train and it makes no sense for them to buy a Multi
Pass, but they still want to travel cheaply. We’ll call them “buyers”.
We will offer sellers an amount for each remaining ride. This amount will depend on the
remaining validity of the Rail Pass. If the expiry date is far away, we can offer more money,
than for a Rail Pass with a nearby expiry date. Why? Because we don’t want to take the risk
of not finding a buyer for the remaining rides.
